This is an application that fetches flight data from an .xml file, reads, manipulates and displays relevant information using React Redux for the front-end.

This is not a complete project and much of the output could be displayed in a more elegant fashion 
IE: 
-Proportion of flights could be displayed as a pie chart, encompassing the curious fact;
-Most daily departures from Manchester could have every flight displayed as a card;

Instructions to run:

1 - extract files onto a directory of your choice
2 - cd traveltek-assignment/server
3 - npm install
4 - node index.mjs
5 - cd ../client
6 - npm install
7 - npm start

after npm start, give React a couple of minutes to start a page, once the page loads feel free to navigate and interact.

Note: the .xml file is located at traveltek-assignment/server/data/
